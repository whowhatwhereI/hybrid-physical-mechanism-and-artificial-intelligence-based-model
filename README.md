# hybrid-physical-mechanism-and-artificial-intelligence-based-model
A model developed without urban pipeline data, which combines physical mechanisms and artificial intelligence, and uses easily accessible traditional NPS model parameters, was the first to explore the newly emerging NPS pesticide pollution in mega cities

The model algorithm is stored in the _ algorithm. py file

The raw data is stored in the data folder

3_3 The training of the runoff module is responsible for the training of the model. py

4_2 The _predicted_runflow_organization. py is responsible for predicting the results of the runoff module, which are stored in 4_predicted_runflow/2_runflow (currently only one sub watershed result file is retained)

5_2 Responsible for training the pesticide concentration module with _pesticide_trainpy

5_3 The _ esticide_pred. py is responsible for predicting the results of the pesticide concentration module, which are stored in 5_ esticide/3_ red (currently only one sub watershed result file is retained)
